## Assignment Overview
This project contains a series of Lex programs developed to solve various problems related to text analysis, validation, and basic computation. The programs were designed to handle specific tasks, ranging from counting characters, words, and spaces in a given text, to validating emails, passwords, and URLs. Additionally, there are programs that recognize human language scripts, handle simple arithmetic operations, and validate university student IDs.

## Exercises Covered

### Program to Count Characters, Words, Spaces, and Lines
   This program counts the number of characters, words, spaces, and lines in an input file.

### Program to Validate Email Address
  This program validates an email address using a regular expression pattern.

### Program to Validate Password
   The program checks if a password is valid based on specific rules:
   - Password must be greater than 8 characters long
   - Password must contain at least one uppercase letter
   - Password must contain at least one lowercase letter
   - Password must contain at least one digit
   - Password must contain at least one special character

### Simple Calculator Lex Program
   A basic Lex program that implements a calculator capable of handling addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### URL Validation Lex Program
   This program validates URLs, ensuring they follow the correct format for http and https links.

### Woldia University Student ID Validation
   This program checks the validity of student IDs from Woldia University, ensuring that the format follows the expected structure.

### Recognition of Human Language Scripts
   The program identifies and distinguishes at least five well-known human language scripts, including:
   - Amharic (Ge'ez)
   - Latin
   - Cyrillic
   - Devanagari
   - Arabic

### Amharic/Ge'ez Character Recognition
   The program recognizes characters from the Amharic (Ge'ez) script, including different orders of Ge'ez characters such as:
   - ሳድስ (6th order)
   - ራብዕ (7th order)
   - ሳልስ (4th order)
   - And all seven orders.

### Longest Word Length Detection
   This program identifies the longest word in a text and displays its length.

### Identification and Counting of Positive and Negative Numbers
   This program classifies numbers as positive or negative and counts how many of each type appear in the input.
